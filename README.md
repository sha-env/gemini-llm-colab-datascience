## Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to help data scientists leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Google Gemini API. With ready-to-use notebooks, examples, and tools, this project makes it easier to experiment with AI, analyze data, and automate workflows. Whether you are exploring natural language processing, data insights, or AI-driven decision-making, this repository provides a solid foundation for your projects.

## Demonstration

Here’s a quick demo showcasing how to integrate Gemini API with Python:

```python
# gemini_demo.py

from google import genai

# Initialize Gemini client
client = genai.Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Example prompt for data scientists
prompt = """
You are a helpful assistant for data scientists.
Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in simple terms.
"""

# Send request to Gemini
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-pro",
    contents=prompt
)

# Print the output
print("Gemini Response:\n")
print(response.text)
```

Run the script:

```
python gemini_demo.py
```

## Project Setup

To prepare this project in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sha-env/gemini-llm-colab-datascience.git
   ```
2. **Upload the cloned directory to Google Drive**
   
   This ensures easy access and management from Colab.

3. **Open the notebook (.ipynb) in Google Colab**
   
   Navigate to the uploaded folder in Drive, right-click the file → Open with → Google Colaboratory

## Steps to Run

1. **Open the notebook in Google Colab from your Google Drive**

2. **Run the cells sequentially to install dependencies and set up the environment**

3. **Start experimenting**

   - Interact with LLM-based tools directly inside Colab
   - Test Gemini API integration for your data science tasks
   - Extend and customize workflows for AI-powered projects
